## Data Cleaning and Preparation Log

This log details the final cleaning and preparation steps performed on the `deutschepost` location dataset. The primary objective was to refine the data by removing irrelevant information, standardizing formats, and saving a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

---
### Steps Performed:

1.  **Filtering by Location Type**
    * The `keyWord` column was analyzed to ensure the dataset contained only relevant location types.
    * Rows with the `Poststation` type were identified as irrelevant and subsequently removed.
    * The final dataset was filtered to include only `Postfiliale` and `Postbank Filiale` locations.

2.  **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
    * To simplify the dataset and remove redundant information, a number of columns not required for analysis were dropped. This included `additionalInfo`, `systemID`, `primaryKeyPF`, `district`, and others.

3.  **Renaming Columns**
    * Several columns were renamed to improve readability and adhere to the standard `snake_case` naming convention. 
    * For example, `zipCode` was changed to `zip_code`, `locationName` to `location_name`, and `primaryKeyDeliverySystem` to `id`.

4.  **Adjusting Data Types**
    * The data types for the `zip_code` and `id` columns were explicitly converted to `object` (string). This ensures that these fields are treated as textual labels rather than numerical values, preventing potential errors from unintended mathematical operations.

5.  **Saving the Final Output**
    * The resulting clean and formatted DataFrame was successfully saved to a new file at `clean/deutschepost_clean.csv`.
