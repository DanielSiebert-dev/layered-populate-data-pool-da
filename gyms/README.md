# üèãÔ∏è Berlin Gyms Data Pipeline

This folder contains all scripts and sources to extract, clean, enrich, and import Berlin gyms data for the [layered-populate-data-pool-da](../) project.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Extract gyms from OpenStreetMap using Overpass API**
2. **Transform and clean raw OSM data for database import**
3. **Spatial join: Assign each gym to a Berlin district**
4. **Import cleaned gyms with district info into the Postgres/PostGIS database**

See [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md) for details and running instructions.
