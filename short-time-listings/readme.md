## üß© 2. Modelling & Planning

### üìå Key Parameters Selected
We focused on columns related to:
- Listing details (price, availability, room type)
- Host information
- Neighborhood details
- Reviews and ratings
- Location coordinates

### üîó Data Relationships
- Listings are connected with neighborhoods.
- Hosts identified by `host_id`.
- Geospatial linkage through `latitude` and `longitude`.

### üìù Planned Schema
The schema captures core listing information, normalized host data, and neighborhood references to maintain data integrity and facilitate analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Known Issues

- Missing or inconsistent data in review scores and price fields.
- Some host names contain special characters or multiple hosts listed.

---

üßπ 5. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Prices cleaned by removing currency symbols and commas, then converted to float.


Host-related columns normalized (e.g., converted host_is_superhost and host_identity_verified to boolean).


Date columns converted to datetime (host_since) for easier time-based analysis.


Text columns cleaned for consistent capitalization and removal of special characters.


Amenities remain as raw strings and can be parsed into lists for detailed feature analysis.


Missing values handled contextually using techniques like median imputation or left as nulls where appropriate.


Standardized neighbourhood_group_cleansed:


Stripped extra white spaces to ensure clean matching.


Applied a mapping dictionary to rename values to human-readable and standardized district names (e.g., 'Charlottenburg-Wilm.' ‚Üí 'Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf').


Renamed the column to neighborhood for simplicity and clarity.
