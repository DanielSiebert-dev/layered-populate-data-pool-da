## üß© 2. Modelling & Planning

### üìå Key Parameters Selected
We focused on columns covering:  
- Listing details (e.g., price, availability, room type)  
- Host information (e.g., host IDs, listing counts)  
- Neighborhood and district details  
- Reviews and ratings (including detailed review scores)  
- Location coordinates and geometry data  

### üîó Data Relationships
- Listings are linked to neighborhoods via the `neighborhood` column.  
- Hosts are uniquely identified by `host_id`.  
- Geospatial information is represented by `latitude`, `longitude`, and the `geometry` column for spatial analysis.  

### üìù Planned Schema
The schema is designed to:  
- Capture core listing attributes and pricing  
- Normalize host-related data for consistency  
- Reference neighborhoods to maintain data integrity  
- Incorporate geospatial data to enable location-based analysis and visualization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Known Issues

- Missing or inconsistent data in review scores and price fields.

---

## üßπ 5. Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Prices cleaned by removing currency symbols and commas, then converted to float.

- Text columns cleaned for consistent capitalization and removal of special characters.

- Amenities remain as raw strings and can be parsed into lists for detailed feature analysis.

- Missing values handled contextually using techniques like median imputation or left as nulls where appropriate.

- Standardized `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`:

    - Stripped extra white spaces to ensure clean matching.

    - Applied a mapping dictionary to rename values to human-readable and standardized district names (e.g., 'Charlottenburg-Wilm.' ‚Üí 'Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf').

    - Renamed the column to `district` for simplicity and clarity.
