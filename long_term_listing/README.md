üè† Long-Term Listings in Berlin (Immowelt) ‚Äì Data Integration

This repository documents the process of integrating Long-Term Listings in Berlin from Immowelt into the database. The project involved scraping, cleaning, and enriching rental listings with geolocation data for analysis.

üìä Project Overview

Data Source: Immowelt (Berlin long-term rental listings)
Collection Method: Web scraping (no API available)
Total Listings Collected: 1246
Listings Dropped: 79 (outside Berlin, from Brandenburg)
Final Listings Inserted: 1167
Unique Neighborhoods Identified: 89

Challenges:

Immowelt applies privacy & scraping limits (only partial listings extractable per request).
Raw data had missing/abbreviated addresses and inconsistent formats.

üß™ Step 1: Research & Data Modelling

1.1 Data Source Discovery
Source: Immowelt website (scraped HTML pages)
Update Frequency: Static snapshot (one-time scrape)
Data Type: Static listings dataset
Additional Enrichment: Used Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) for geolocation to retrieve coordinates based on addresses.

1.2 Modelling & Planning
Selected key parameters:
Street & house number
Type
Postal code
District (Bezirk)
City
Price
Size (m¬≤)
Number of rooms
Coordinates (lat, lon from Nominatim)

Known Issues:
Some addresses incomplete or abbreviated (e.g., "Str." vs. "Stra√üe").
Duplicated entries possible due to multiple appearances of similar ads.
Not all addresses resolved by Nominatim.

1.3 Sources Directory
Raw scraped files stored in /sources.
/sources/README.md contains documentation of scraping steps and transformation plan.

üõ† Step 2: Data Transformation
Implemented transformation logic using Python:

House Type Normalization

Different types of H√§user (e.g., Reihenhaus, Einfamilienhaus, Doppelhaus) were standardized to house.
Different types of Wohnungen (e.g., Dachgeschosswohnung, Erdgeschosswohnung, Loft) were standardized to wohnung.

Address Cleaning

Normalized abbreviations: "Str." ‚Üí "Stra√üe".
Separated street names (letters) and house numbers (numeric part).

Floor Normalization

"Erdgeschoss" was standardized to 0.
Other floors converted to numeric values: 1, 2, 3, 4....

Other Cleaning & Processing

Extracted postal codes and districts.
Queried Nominatim for missing coordinates.
Dropped listings outside Berlin (79 listings from Brandenburg).
Added district_id for each listing to reference the district table.
Performed further cleaning in spreadsheets for consistency and quality.
Scripts are located in /scripts.
Outputs tested locally before database population.

üß© Step 3: Populate Database

Transformed data inserted into the database using SSM tunnel to securely connect to the remote database.
The table was created with foreign key constraints to link listings to the districts reference table.
Established relationships with existing neighborhoods and geospatial tables.
Verified correctness of inserted data and linkage with neighborhood boundaries.

üåç Geolocation with Nominatim

Geocoding was performed using Nominatim (OpenStreetMap).
Each cleaned address was passed to Nominatim for latitude/longitude retrieval.

Limitations: Some incomplete addresses could not be geocoded.
