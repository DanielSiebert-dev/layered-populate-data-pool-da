## Project Update - Database Table Design
### Date: 21/08/2025

Today, our group reached key milestones in preparing our property listings database:

- Agreed on table constraints: We defined and approved essential constraints to ensure data integrity in the database.
- Finalized table structure: The columns and their types are now fixed, aligned with our data needs and analysis plans.
- Unique identifiers: We established district_id as a foreign key (linking each listing to its district) and listing_id as the primary key for each record, ensuring every          row is uniquely identifiable.

Next steps will focus on implementing these definitions in the database system and preparing our data for import.

## Data Transformation & Documentation

## Example Data

See [sample.csv](long_term_listing/examples/immowelt_page_1.csv) for a small example of the raw data before cleaning.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Data Cleaning

Today, our group began the data cleaning process on the raw dataset. Specifically, we:

 - Applied Python cleaning functions to explore the dataset after transformations.

 - Checked for inconsistencies in formatting (e.g., variations in values across columns).

 - Identified empty and missing values that need to be addressed.

This work gives us a clearer picture of the datasetâ€™s current state and helps define the next steps for standardizing the data.
