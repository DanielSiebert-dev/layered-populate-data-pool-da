# Research: Open API ‚Äî Katia Micello

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **`research-open-API-katia-micello.ipynb`**, which documents and demonstrates the research process for interacting with an open API (exact API and research goals to be filled in based on notebook contents).

---

## üìÑ Overview

The notebook aims to:
1. Explore the selected Open API‚Äôs capabilities and endpoints.
2. Document authentication requirements (if any).
3. Test API calls and review their responses.
4. Outline potential data points for integration into the main project.

> **Note:** Replace this section with a specific description once the exact API and scope from the notebook are confirmed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment activated (optional but recommended).
- Required packages installed (see below).

### Install Jupyter Notebook
```bash
pip install notebook
```

### Install Other Dependencies
If the notebook includes a `requirements.txt`, install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, install libraries as needed. For typical API research, common packages include:
```bash
pip install requests pandas
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter Lab:
   - In VS Code: double-click `research-open-API-katia-micello.ipynb`.
   - Or in terminal:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook research-open-API-katia-micello.ipynb
     ```
2. Select the correct Python interpreter (your virtual environment).
3. Run cells in order from top to bottom.

## üß© Notebook Structure

While details will depend on the notebook contents, a typical flow includes:
1. **Introduction & Goals** ‚Äî Context for the API being researched.
2. **Authentication Setup** ‚Äî How to obtain and use an API key (if applicable).
3. **Test Requests** ‚Äî Making example API calls.
4. **Data Exploration** ‚Äî Reviewing JSON responses and extracting fields of interest.
5. **Next Steps** ‚Äî Notes on potential uses for the data.

## üìÇ Output

Depending on implementation, the notebook may produce:
- JSON response samples
- CSV/Excel datasets
- Documentation snippets for the API

Check the notebook cells for file-save locations.

## üìå Next Steps

- Finalize this README with **specific API name**, **purpose**, and **key findings** from the notebook.
- Decide whether to adapt API queries into production scrapers or keep as reference.
