# 0 General OSM
üåç OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, collaborative map of the world that anyone can edit.
- It contains geospatial data: roads, railways, buildings, parks, rivers, amenities (caf√©s, hospitals, schools, etc.).
- Data is stored as:
  - Nodes (points, e.g. bus stops, caf√©s).
  - Ways (lines/polygons, e.g. roads, parks, building outlines).
  - Relations (groupings, e.g. bus routes, administrative boundaries).
- Everything is tagged with simple key=value pairs (e.g. amenity=cafe, highway=residential).

Most OSM objects will at least have:
- Identity (name, operator, brand)
- Location (addr:*)
- Availability (opening_hours, access)
- Contact (phone, website)
- Accessibility (wheelchair)

Data can be retrieved by using the following Python code:
```
import osmnx as ox
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd

# populating a dataframe
tags = {"amenity": "university"}
university_gdf = ox.features_from_place("Berlin, Germany", tags)
university_gdf.info()
```
Example output:
```
<class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'>
MultiIndex: 117 entries, ('node', np.int64(278540049)) to ('way', np.int64(1211946568))
Data columns (total 87 columns):

geometry contains information about longitude and latitude of an object and is provided in the format: POINT (13.35074 52.42464)

## 1.1: in addition **district and district_id** shouild be added to all layers

# 2 Layer-by-Layer Review of Existing Data Sources
All columns shown in the table above should be added to all layers, independently if they are available in the legacy database or not.
In addition to these OSM or non-OSM columns have to be added according to legacy database.
