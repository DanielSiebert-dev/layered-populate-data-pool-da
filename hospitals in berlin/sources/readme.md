I got the dataset for Hospitals in Berlin from DKV website:

   Source and origin: https://www.deutsches-krankenhaus-verzeichnis.de/app/suche/ergebnis

   Update frequency: Annualy 

   Data type: static

Process for data collection and cleaning:
   1. I copied the data form the DKV website and pasted it in the spreedsheet.
   2. Through REGEXEXTRACT I extracted post code from the name.
   3. By clicking on the hyperlink I got the address and location for the google maps.
   4. Then I cleaned the Distance column by using Text to column fuction.
   5. And removed the decimal from the rest numerical columns.
   
* Where ever the cases is 0 the hospital's data was not updated by the last quality report.
